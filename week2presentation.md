### Big Idea
The main purpose of this website is to introduce people to Avinh's cooking club by  using a visually appealing interface to present information about the club such as: important dates, past meetings, and slightly plagerized recipies

Our sponser is the founder of the Cooking Club and fellow member of AP Computer Science Principles. 

### GitHub License
