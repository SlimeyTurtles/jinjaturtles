## Project Design Plan
This website is dedicated to the spectacular "Cooking Club!"

We wanted to make an easy to use interface that included recipes created by the Cooking Club. The mission of this club is to teach people how to cook, so whenever they're hungry, making dinner, or surprising someone, they can utilize the resources and skills provided by the Cooking Club. 

There will be several main features:
- A contact page for people interested in the club
- A recipe catalog (being able to add recipies, search for recipies)
- Review recipies or comment (kind of like Yelp reviews)
